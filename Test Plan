1.0 INTRODUCTION
    The product being tested is my senior project of an android application that allows the user to enter in a place/buisness to recieve step by step instructions how to get there by using the Google Maps API. I would also add differnt funcitonalities I have seen elsewhere like a easy accident reporting feature, and a speed trap reporting feature. 

2.0 OBJECTIVES AND TASKS

2.1 Objectives
    The objectives are to create a basic application to give the user a good map application experience that is somewhat different from the base Google Maps.

2.2 Tasks
    The tasks that will need to be completed are: the test plan, testing implementation, fixes in the functionality and input validations that were not caught, then more funtction additions past just the base that I currently have. 

3.0 TESTING STRATEGY
    Since I am the only person working on this project I will be doing all the testing. I plan on using unit and functional testing for this project. 

3.1 Unit Testing

Definition: Unit testing is the testing of specific units and modules of the program. 

Methodology: I plan on going through each module in the program and seeing what is being passed into each method and testing inputs that way for them. On top of this I plan on coming up with different input cases that could have issues that need to be found.  

3.2 Functional Testing

Definition: Funcitonal testing is the testing of the overall function of the project. 

Methodology: I plan on testing the functionality of the project by: first creating a list of different functions where I believe there could be issues, then I will go through each case and test them, then I will document my results, and after that I will update the project however needed.   

4.0 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
    A computer. 
    A phone that has an android operating system with a usb cable(optional). 

5.0 ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS
    Android Studio installed. 
    If no phone with android then the installation of an AVD(Android Virtual Device) is necessary. 

6.0 TEST SCHEDULE
    The first milestone is this test plan, next I plan on creating the test cases and doing more testing over the winter break, lastly I will turn in the code for the program. 

7.0 FEATURES TO BE TESTED
    The features that need testing are: the input for the map, the movement of the map, and the ability to get directions from Google Maps.

8.0 FEATURES NOT TO BE TESTED
    The main feature that I believe does not need any testing is the inital input button to get into the map page.

9.0 TOOLS
    I plan on using the test files provided in the android studio app, I will also look into seeing if there is something like the JUnit testing like there is for the base version of Java.
